# Schulte Tables

[Exercise](https://cup0fcoffee.github.io/schulte-tables/)


## What is it?

A **Schulte Table** is a grid of numbers placed in random order. It is used as
an exercise to improve *peripheral vision*, which can be useful for improving
reading speed.


## How to practice?

**The exercise can be very fatiguing. 10 trainings per day is probably the
maximum you should do.**

* Focus your eyes on the center of the grid.
* Using your peripheral vision, i.e. without moving your eyes, search and click
    on numbers in the ascending order starting with **1**.

Use `Grid Width` setting above the grid to adjust the width of the grid.
As you get better, you can increase `Grid Size`.
